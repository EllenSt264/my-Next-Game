The web application must offer a wide selection of games for users to browse through, and sort those games into relevant categories to make the navigation of the site easy and intuitive. It is also important to include C-R-U-D functionality to site that meets user expectations and follows the overarching schema of the project.

The primary goal is to establish a community platform that would have the potential to grow and thrive as a real-world application. It is imperative that the application has a high-quality layout and UX design, meets acccessibility guidelines, prioritizes its information appropriately and handles the back-end intuitively. 

### Target Audience 

The target audience is gamers, coming from a wide range of platforms and backgrounds. However, the site is more catered to PC gamers as the game data that is used in the web application derives from a PC video game distrubtion service: Steam. Also, a majority of the games present on the site have an age rating that is only suitable for late teenage years and above.
